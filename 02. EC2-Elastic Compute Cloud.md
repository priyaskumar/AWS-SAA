_EC2 - ELASTIC COMPUTE CLOUD_
==
- popular AWS' offering
- EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud = Infrastructure as a Service
- Consists in the capability of :

    - Renting virtual machines -> EC2
    - storing data on virtual drives -> EBS
    - distributing load across machines -> ELB (Elastic Load Balance)
    - scaling services using an auto-scaling group -> ASG

# EC2 - sizing and configuration options

- OS : Linus/Windows/Mac OS
- Compute Power and cores (CPU)
- RAM
- Storage Space
    - Network attached (EBS and EFS)
    - Hardware/ Physical Storage (EC2 Instance Store)
- Network card 
- Firewall rules
    - Security Groups to control incoming and outgoing traffic
- EC2 user data script :
    - To bootstrap EC2 instances
    - runs only during the first start of the EC2 instance
    - runs with the root user; has sudo previliges
    - Used to:
        - Install packages
        - Update/Upgrade packages
- NOTE : AWS Free Tier provide 750 hrs of t2.micro and 30GB of EBS volume storage per month per Organization
# EC2 User Data

- to bootstrap our instances using the script
- runs only once on starting the instance
- has sudo previleges

- An example :
    ```
    #! /bin/bash
    # Use this for your user data (script from top to bottom)
    # install httpd (Linux 2 version)
    yum update -y
    yum install -y httpd
    systemctl start httpd
    systemctl enable httpd
    echo "<h1>Hello world from $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
    ```

# EC2 Instance Types

_*GENERAL PURPOSE*_ :

- great for diversity of workloads such as web browsers
- balance b/w :
    - compute
    - memory
    - networking
- t2.micro -> general purpose EC2 instance

_*COMPUTE OPTIMIZED*_

- great for compute-intensive tasks that require high performance processors 
    - batch processing workloads
    - media transcoding
    - high performance web servers
    - high performance computing
    - scientific modeling & machine learning
    - dedicated gaming servers
- c4, c5, c5a, c5n, c6g
- c5d.4xlarge -> Compute Optimized EC2 instance

_*MEMORY OPTIMIZED*_

- great for fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory
- Use case :
    - high performance relational/non relational databases
    - distributed web scale cache stores
    - in-memory databases optimized for Business Intelligence (BI)
    - applications performing real-time processing of big unstructured data
- r4, r5, r5a, r5e, x1, x1e 
- r5.16xlarge -> memory optimized EC2 instance

_*STORAGE OPTIMIZED*_

- great for storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage
- Use cases :
    - high frequency online transaction processing systems
    - relational & NoSQL databases
    - cache for in-memory databases
    - data warehousing applications
    - distributed file system
- d2, d3, h1

_NOTE_ :   
Consider t2.micro  
- t denotes the class of EC2 instance
- 2 denotes the generation (or version) 
- micro is the size of the instance (large, small, 2xlarge)

# Security Groups

- a firewall for EC2 instances

- controls the incoming traffic and outgoing traffic from/to the EC2 instances

- lives outside the EC2 instances, so if a traffic is blocked, an EC2 instance would not even see it

- SG contains only allow rules

- All inbound traffic is blocked by default
All outgoing traffic is allowed by default

- If you're launching a web application in an EC2 instance, and you're seeing a timeout error, it means that it is a SG issue

- If it's a connection refused error, then it's an application issue

- SGs are referenced by IP adresses or other SGs

- One SG can be attached to multiple instances
And similarly, one instance can have multiple SGs

- SGs are scoped to a region/VPC

# Commmon Ports

- 22 - SSH

- 21 - FTP

- 22 - SFTP (Secure FTP). File transfer using SSH

- 80 - HTTP

- 443 - HTTPS

- 3389 - RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) for logging into Windows instance

# Connecting to an instance
There are three ways that you can connect to an EC2 instance
- SSH - for Linux/Mac/Windows10+

- PuTTy - for any version of Windows

- EC2 Instance Connect - can connect to EC2 instance from the AWS console

NOTE : You need to have port 22 enabled to use EC2 instance connect

# Spot Instances

- To initiate a spot request, you specify the following

    - Max Price
    - No. of instances
    - Launch Configuration
    - Request type -> One-time / Persistent
    - Valid From, Valid Until

- If the spot price is greater than the max price, the instance is lost

    - Given two operations to perfrom within a grace period of two minutes after the price becomes greater
        - Stop
        - Terminate
    - Stopping the instance will allow you to restart the instance if the spot price drops below the max price again

- Fresh instances are started if the instances are configured to be terminated

- Spot prices do vary based on AZ

- There is another option called Spot Block which is outdated and only available till Dec 2022
    - In this, the spot instances are reserved from anywhere between 1 to 6 hours

- If the request type is Persistent, then the Spot Request keeps on requesting for spot instances once the instances are terminated.

    - If you need to actually stop an instance, you need to cancel the spot request first and then stop the instances
    - Because, if you stop the instance first, the request is automatically going to request another instance
    - Cancelling a spot request does not terminate spot instances; need to be terminated seperately

- If the request type is 'one-time', then it only requests for spot requests once until the request is satisfied

# Spot Fleet

- Spot Fleet -> Spot instances + On-demand instances

- A number of launch pools for Spot fleet is defined to choose from

- Launch pools consists of variations of OS, AZ, Instance type (M5 large)

- Spot fleet chooses from the best launch pool according to the launch strategy and meets the target capacity

- Launch startegies can be
    - _*lowestPrice*_: Launches from the optimal pool which provides the lowest price
    - _*Diversified*_: Launches from multiple pools
    - _*capacityOptimized*_: Pool with optimal capacity
# _Summary_

- Creating EC2 Instance : has to define the following
    - AMI (os)
    - Instance Size (CPU + RAM)
    - Storage
    - Security groups
    - EC2 User data

- SECURITY GROUPS are firewall attached to the EC2 Instance

- EC2 USER DATA is the script launched at the first start of the instance

- SSH is used to start a terminal into our EC2 instances (port 22)

- EC2 Instance Role is a link to IAM roles

- Purchasing options:
    - On-demand
    - Spot
    - Reserved (Standard + Convertible + Scheduled)
    - Dedicated Host
    - Dedicated Instance

# _NOTE_

1. Reserved Instances are good for long workloads. You can reserve instances for 1 or 3 years.

2. Spot Instances are good for short workloads, but are less reliable.  
    Can provide the biggest discount, but is not suitable for critical jobs or databases

3. Security Groups is a security tool that operates at instance level and can control traffic in and out of EC2 instances.

4. The customer is responsible for operating-system patches and updates on EC2 Instances, as well as data security on the instances, Security Groups rules, etc.

5. 1 year or 3 years terms are available for EC2 Reserved Instances.

6. _*Compute Optimized EC2 instances*_ are great for compute-intensive workloads requiring high performance processors, such as 
    - batch processing, 
    - media transcoding, 
    - high performance web servers, 
    - high performance computing, 
    - scientific modeling & machine learning
    - dedicated gaming servers.
