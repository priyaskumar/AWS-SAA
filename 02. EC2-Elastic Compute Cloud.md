_EC2 - ELASTIC COMPUTE CLOUD_
==
- popular AWS' offering
- EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud = Infrastructure as a Service
- Consists in the capability of :

    - Renting virtual machines -> EC2
    - storing data on virtual drives -> EBS
    - distributing load across machines -> ELB (Elastic Load Balance)
    - scaling services using an auto-scaling group -> ASG

# EC2 - sizing and configuration options

- OS : Linus/Windows/Mac OS
- Compute Power and cores (CPU)
- RAM
- Storage Space
    - Network attached (EBS and EFS)
    - Hardware (EC2 Instance Store)
- Network card 
- Firewall rules
- EC2 user data

# EC2 User Data

- to bootstrap our instances using the script
- runs only once on starting the instance


- An example :
    ```
    #! /bin/bash
    # Use this for your user data (script from top to bottom)
    # install httpd (Linux 2 version)
    yum update -y
    yum install -y httpd
    systemctl start httpd
    systemctl enable httpd
    echo "<h1>Hello world from $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
    ```

# EC2 Instance Types

_*GENERAL PURPOSE*_ :

- great for diversity of workloads such as web browsers
- balance b/w :
    - compute
    - memory
    - networking
- t2.micro -> general purpose EC2 instance

_*COMPUTE OPTIMIZED*_

- great for compute-intensive tasks that require high performance processors 
    - batch processing workloads
    - media transcoding
    - high performance web servers
    - high performance computing
    - scientific modeling & machine learning
    - dedicated gaming servers
- c4, c5, c5a, c5n, c6g
- c5d.4xlarge -> Compute Optimized EC2 instance

_*MEMORY OPTIMIZED*_

- great for fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory
- Use case :
    - high performance relational/non relational databases
    - distributed web scale cache stores
    - in-memory databases optimized for Business Intelligence (BI)
    - applications performing real-time processing of big unstructured data
- r4, r5, r5a, r5e, x1, x1e 
- r5.16xlarge -> memory optimized EC2 instance

_*STORAGE OPTIMIZED*_

- great for storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage
- Use cases :
    - high frequency online transaction processing systems
    - relational & NoSQL databases
    - cache for in-memory databases
    - data warehousing applications
    - distributed file system
- d2, d3, h1

# Summary

- Creating EC2 Instance : has to define the following
    - AMI (os)
    - Instance Size (CPU + RAM)
    - Storage
    - Security groups
    - EC2 User data

- SECURITY GROUPS are firewall attached to the EC2 Instance

- EC2 USER DATA is the script launched at the first start of the instance

- SSH is used to start a terminal into our EC2 instances (port 22)

- EC2 Instance Role is a link to IAM roles

- Purchasing options:
    - On-demand
    - Spot
    - Reserved (Standard + Convertible + Scheduled)
    - Dedicated Host
    - Dedicated Instance

# Note

1. Reserved Instances are good for long workloads. You can reserve instances for 1 or 3 years.

2. Spot Instances are good for short workloads, but are less reliable.  
    Can provide the biggest discount, but is not suitable for critical jobs or databases

3. Security Groups is a security tool that operates at instance level and can control traffic in and out of EC2 instances.

4. The customer is responsible for operating-system patches and updates on EC2 Instances, as well as data security on the instances, Security Groups rules, etc.

5. 1 year or 3 years terms are available for EC2 Reserved Instances.

6. _*Compute Optimized EC2 instances*_ are great for compute-intensive workloads requiring high performance processors, such as 
    - batch processing, 
    - media transcoding, 
    - high performance web servers, 
    - high performance computing, 
    - scientific modeling & machine learning
    - dedicated gaming servers.
