# S3 - infinitely scaling storage

# S3 Buckets

- S3 allows to store objects (files) in buckets (directories)

- buckets must have a globally unique name 

- though S3 is a global service, buckets are defined at regional level

- Naming convention of buckets :

    - No uppercase

    - No underscore

    - 3-63 characters long

    - shouldn't be an IP

    - must start with lowercase letter or number


## Objects

- objects have a key (it is a full path)  
    Eg :  s3://my-bucket/my_folder/another_folder/my_file.txt 
    - bucket -> my-bucket
    
    - key -> my_folder/another_folder/my_file.txt

- key = prefix + object name

    - prefix : my_folder/another_folder/

    - object name : my_file.txt

- there's no concept of directories within buckets, they're just keys with very long names that contain slashes

- object values = content of the body

    - max size : 5TB

    - can't upload more than 5GB at a time. in order to do so use `multi-part upload`

- metadata = list of text key - value pairs (system or user metadata)

- tags = unicode key - value pair up to 10 which are useful for security

- Version ID - when versioning is enabled

# S3 - versioning

- versioning enabled at bucket level

- helps to protect against unintended deletes

- easy roll back to previous versions

- any file that is not versioned prior to enabling versioning will have version - 'full'

- suspending versioning will not delete the previous versions

# S3 - encryption

4 methods 

- **_SSE-S3_** : (Server Side Encryption - S3)

    - encryption using keys handled & managed by Amazon S3

    - object is encrypted server side 

    - HTTP/ HTTPS to be used to upload the object into S3

    - AES-256 encryption (algorithm)

    - must set header - `"x-amz-server-side-encryption":"AES256"`

- **_SSE-KMS_** : (Server Side Encryption - Key Management service)

    - encryption using keys handled & managed by KMS

    - Advantage : user control, audit trail

    - object is encrypted server side

    - HTTP/ HTTPS to be used to upload the object into S3

    - must set header - `"x-amz-server-side-encryption":"aws:kms"`

- **_SSE-C_** : 

    - encryption using data keys fully managed by the customer outside of AWS

    - S3 doesn't store the encryption keys

    - HTTPS must be used to upload the object into S3

    - Encryption must be provided in HTTP header for every HTTP request made

- **_Client side encryption_** :

    - Client library such as Amazon S3 Encrytpion Client enables us to perform the Client side encryption

    - Clients must encrypt and decrypt data themselves before sending to and when receiving from S3

    - Customer fully manages the keys and encryption cycle

# Encryption in Transit

- Amazon S3 exposes:

    - HTTP endpoint: non encrypted

    - HTTPS endpoint: encryption in flight

- You're free to use the endpoint you want, but HTTPS is recommended

- Most clients would use HTTPS endpoint by default

- HTTPS is mandatory for SSE-C

- Encyption in flight is also called SSL/TLS

# S3 Security

- **_User based_** :

    - IAM policies - which API calls should be allowed for a specific user from IAM console

- **_Resource based_** :

    - Bucket policies - bucket wide rules from the S3 console - allows cross account

    - Object Access Control List (ACL) - finer grain

    - Bucket Access Control List (ACL) - less common

- an IAM principal can access an S3 object if

    - the user IAM permissions allow it or the resource policy ALLOWS it

    - and there's no explicit DENY

## S3 Bucket Policies

- JSON based policies

- can be used to Grant Public Access to the bucket

- Force objects to be encrypted at upload

- Grant Access to another account (Cross Account)

## Bucket Settings for Block Public Access

- Blocks public access to buckets and objects granted through : 
    
    - new access control list (ACLs)

    - any access control list (ACLs)

    - new public bucket or access point policies

- These settings were created to prevent company data leaks

- Can be enabled at account level

## Others 

- **_Networking_** :

    - Supports VPC Endpoints (for instances in VPC without www internet)

- **_Logging and Audit_** : 

    - S3 Access Logs can be stored in another S3 bucket

    - API calls can be logged in CloudTrail

- **_User Security_**

    - **MFA Delete**: MFA can be a requirement in versioned buckets to delete objects

    - **Pre-Signed URLs**: URLs that are valid only for a limited time

# S3 Websites

- S3 allows us to host static websites on the www

- The website URL will be:
    ```
    <bucket-name>.s3-website-.amazonaws.com OR
    <bucket-name>.s3-website..amazonaws.com
    ```

- If you get a 403 Forbidden Error, make sure bucket policy allows public reads

- To make objects public in a bucket, you need to : 

    - Disable block public access
    
    - Create a bucket policy that allows public access

# S3 CORS - Cross Origin Resource Sharing

- An origin is a scheme(protocol), host(domain) and port  
    Eg: https://example.com
    - protocol - https
    
    - domain - example.com

    - Port 443 for HTTPS

- CORS is a web browser based mechanism to allow request to other origins while visiting main origin

- Same origins: http://example.com/app1 & http://example.com/app2

- Different Origins: http://example.com/ & http://mynotes.com/

- The requests won't be fulfilled unless the other origin allows for the requests using CORS Headers (eg: Access-Control-Allow-Origin)

- If a client needs to do a cross-origin request on our S3 bucket, you need to enable the correct CORS headers

- You can allow for a specific origin or for all origins (*)

# Amazon S3 - Consistency Model

- As of December 2020, S3 has been strongly consistent

- Consistent -> a read request after an updation or creation of the object will immediately reflect changes

    - read after write consistency

    - list consistency

- Available at no additional cost, without any performance impact

# S3 - MFA Delete

- MFA forces user to generate a code on their device before doing important operations on S3

- MFA-Delete can be used only if bucket versioning is enabled

- You will need MFA to:

    - Suspend versioning on the bucket

    - Permanantly delete an object version

- You don't need MFA for:

    - Enabling versioning

    - Listing deleted versions

- Only the root account (bucket owner) can enable/disable MFA-Delete

- MFA-Delete currently can be enabled only using the CLI

# S3 - Default Encryption vs Bucket Policies

- Encryption can be done in 2 ways 

    - enable default encryption in the bucket setting

    - use bucket policy and refuse any API call to PUT an S3 object without encryption headers

- The bucket policies are first evaluated before default encryption

# S3 Access Logs

- For audit purposes, you may want to log all access to your S3 buckets

- Any request made to your S3 bucket, from any account, authorized or denied is logged into another S3 buckets of yours

- This data can be analyzed using data analysis tools or Amazon Athena

- _**NOTE**_ : Never set your logging bucket to be your monitored bucket, because it will create an infinite logging loop and your bucket will grow in size exponentially
