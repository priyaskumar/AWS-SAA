# Public IP, Private IP, Elastic IP 

- _PUBLIC IP_ :
    - machine identified on www
    - unique across whole web
    - can be geo located
- _PRIVATE IP_ :
    - machine identified on private network
    - unique across private network 
    - two different networks can have same private IP
    - only specified range of IPs can be used 
    - machines connect to www via NAT device + internet gateway (proxy)

- _ELASTIC IP_ :
    - On stopping and restarting an EC2 instance, its public IP changes
    - Elastic IP is a fixed public IPv4 IP for the instance that doesn't change until the instance is deleted
    - can be attached to one instance at a time
    - You can only have 5 elastic IP in your account
    - _DISADVANTAGE_ : reflects poor architectural decisions
    - _ALTERNATIVES_ :
        - using random public IP and register a DNS name to it
        - using load balancer
    
- In general, an EC2 instance has
    - a private IP -> internal AWS network
    - a public IP -> www

- Public IP has to be used to SSH into EC2 instance as we are not in same network to use private IP

# Placement Groups

- The strategy of how to place the EC2 instance within the AWS infrastructure can be defined using placement groups

- 3 strategies for the group :
    - _CLUSTER_ :
        - instances grouped together in a low latency hardware setup within single AZ
        - ADVANTAGE :
            - high performance
            - super low latency
            - great network speed
        - DISADVANTAGE :
            - high risk
            - one hardware fails, all instances fail
        - _USE CASE_ :
            - big data job
            - an application that requires extremely low latency and high network throughput

    - _SPREAD_ :
        - instances spread across different hardware
        - instances' failure are isolated
        
        - _ADVANTAGE_:
            - minimized risk of simultaneous failure 
            - span across multiple AZ
        
        - _DISADVANTAGE_ :
            - can have only 7 EC2 instances per placement group per AZ

        - _USE CASE_ :
            - application requiring high availability
            - CRITICAL APPLICATIONS  
              
    - _PARTITION_ :
        - instances spread across different partitions; partitons spread across different sets of hardware within an AZ
        - instances' failure are not isolated but one partition isolated from another partition of failure
        - can have & partitions per AZ
        - _ADVANTAGE_ :
            - span across multiple AZ in single region
            - run 100s of EC2 instances
            - each partition failure is isolated
            - EC2 instances get access to partition info as metadata

        - _USE CASE_ :
            - HDFS
            - Hadoop
            - Cassandra
            - Kafka

# Elastic Network Interfaces (ENI)

- represents virtual network card
- a logical component in a VPC
- they give EC2 instances access to the network
- ENI has :
    - Primary private IPv4
    - one or more secondary IPv4
    - one elastic IPv4 per private IPv4
    - one public IPv4
    - one or more security groups
    - a MAC address
- can create ENI independently and attach them to EC2 instances on the fly (move them) when a failover occurs
- bound to a specific AZ

# EC2 Hibernate

- on starting an EC2 instance,
    - OS boots and EC2 user data script runs
    - OS boots up
    - application starts
    - caches get warmed up
- this takes time
- on hibernating EC2 instance,
    - in-memory (RAM) state is preserved
    - instance boot will be faster
    - the RAM state is written to a file in *root EBS volume*
    - root EBS volume must have enough space and must be encrypted
- _USE CASES_ :
    - for long-running process
    - saving RAM state
    - (faster boot up) services that take time to initialize 
- instance RAM size must be less than 150 GB
- Hibernation not more than 60 days

# EC2 Nitro

- next gen of EC2 instances
- uses new virtualization technology
- allows better performance
- better networking options:
    - enhanced networking
    - HPC
    - uses IPv6
- *higher speed EBS* -> increased level of IOPS (IO operations per seconds)
- better security
- instance types : c5, c6, D3, M5 types

# vCPUs 

- multilple threads run on one CPU
- each thread is a vCPU
- eg : m5.2xlarge
    - 4 CPU
    - 2 threads per CPU
    - => 8 vCPUs
- you may need to change no of vCPUs to:
    - decrease no of CPU cores
    - decrease no of threads per Core

# EC2 capacity reservations

- if you need to plan in advance for capacity and make sure that you can launch instances in an AZ of a specific type around the specific timeframe then use EC2 capacity reservations.

- get billed as soon as it starts

- no planned end-date for reservation

- specify :
    - AZ
    - no of instances
    - instance attributes
        - type
        - tenancy
        - platform/OS

# _NOTE_

- Spot Fleet is a set of Spot Instances and optionally On-demand Instances. It allows you to automatically request Spot Instances with the lowest price.
