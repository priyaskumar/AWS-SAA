# EBS Volume

- EBS -> Elastic Block Store

- a network drive (not a physical drive) attached to the instances while running
    - to communicate b/w the instance and EBS Volume, network is used
    - there might be a bit of latency from one computer to reach to another server
    - can be detached from an EC2 instance and attached to another one quickly -> helps in 'failovers'    

- allows instances to persist data after termination
    - can recreate an instance and mount to the same EBS Volume from before and get back our data

- There's 'multi-attach' feature for some EBS
    - an EBS Volume can be attached to multiple instances

- bound to a specific AZ
    - snapshot can be used to move across AZ

- have a provisioned capacity (size in GBs and IOPS)
    - get billed for the provisioned capacity
    - increase the capacity of drive over time (for better performance/ more size)

- ### _DELETE ON TERMINATION_ :
    - controls the EBS behaviour when EC2 instance is terminated
        - by default, root EBS volume is terminated
        - by default, any other EBS volume is not deleted on termination
    
    - controlled by AWS console/ AWS cli

    - USE CASE : to save data -> preserve root volume when instance terminated

- ### _EBS SNAPSHOTS_ :
    - a backup of EBS volume at a point of time

    - can backup the state of EBS volume

    - can restore the EBS volume even after deletion

    - not necessary to detach the volume to do snapshot but recommended so that the volume is clean

    - can copy snapshots across AZ/ region to leverage AWS global infrastructure

    - _*EBS SNAPSHOT ARCHIVE*_ :
        - move a snapshot to archive tier 

        - 75% cheaper

        - takes 24 to 72 hours for restoring the archive

    - _*RECYCLE BIN*_ :
        - setup rules to retain deleted snapshots, to recover them after accidental deletion

        - specify retention (1 day to 1 year) 

- ### _EBS VOLUME TYPES_ :
    - 6 types 
        - _*gp2 (SSD)*_ : (important for exam)
            - General purpose SSD volume 
            - balances price and performance for wide variety of workloads
            - older version of volume
            - SIZE -> 1 GB to 16 TB
            - IOPS :
                - small gp2 volumes -> max 3000 IOPS
                - size of volume and IOPS are linked
                    - max 16000 IOPS
                - 3 IOPS per GB -> at 5334 GB - max IOPS (16000) achieved
            - _ADVANTAGES_:
                - cost effective storage
                - low-latency
            - _DISADVANTAGE_ :
                - IOPS and throughput can't be set independently (linked together)
            - _USE CASES_ :
                - system boot volumes
                - virtual desktop
                - development
                - test environments
            
        - _*gp3 (SSD)*_ :
            - General purpose SSD volume 
            - balances price and performance for wide variety of workloads
            - newer generation of volume
            - gives a baseline of 
                - 3000 IOPS
                - 125 MB/s of throughput
            - can increase to
                - 16000 IOPS
                - 1000 MB/s throughput   
            independently

                - applications that need more than 16000 IOPS

            - when you have a database workload that
                - really uses the storage
                - very sensitive to storage performance and consistency  
            switch to io1/io2 from gp2/gp3

            - supports EBS multi-attach

            - _*io1 (SSD)*_

                    - 64000 -> EC2 Nitro
                    - 32000 -> others
                - can increase PIOPS idependently from storage size
                - has more durability and more IOPS per GB compared to io1

            - _*io2 Block Express (SSD)*_ :
                - SIZE : 4GB to 64 TB
                - sub-millisecond latency
                - Max PIOPS : 256000
                - 1000 IOPS per GB

        - _*st1 (HDD)*_ :
            - Low cost HDD volume
            - used for
                - frequently accessed
                - throughput intensive  
            workloads
            - SIZE : 125 MB to 16 TB
            - THROUGHPUT OPTIMIZED HDD
            - _USE CASE_ :
                - Big data
                - Data warehouses
                - log processing

            - MAX THROUGHPUT : 250 MB/s
            - MAX IOPS : 250

    - EBS volumes are characterised based on some factors like
        - size
        - throughput
        - IOPS

    - For EC2 instances -> gp2/gp3 , io1/io2 can only be used as boot volumes (root OS runs on them)

    - NOTE : if you want to get also over 32,000 IOPS, you need Ec2 Nitro with io1 or io2

- ### _EBS MULTI-ATTACH : (io1/io2 family)_

    - attach same EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances in the same AZ

    - each EC2 instance has full read and write permissions to the volume.

    - the application must be able to manage concurrent write operations into the same volumes.

    - you must use a file system that is cluster-aware

    - used to achieve HIGHER APPLICATION AVAILABILTY

- ### _EBS Encryption_ :

    - When an encrypted EBS volume is created followinf are also encrypted
        - data at rest
        - data in flight moving between instance and volume
        - snapshots
        - volumes created from snapshots

    - has minimal impact on latency

    - copying an uncrypted EBS snapshot allows encryption

    - _HOW TO ENCRYPT AN UNENCRYPTED EBS VOLUME_ :
        - create EBS snapshot of the volume
        - encrypt EBS snapshot by copying
        - create new EBS volume from snapshot
        - the newly created encrypted EBS volume can be attached to some instance

# AMI

- AMI -> Amazon Machine Image

- powers the EC2 instances

- built for specific region 

- _ADVANTAGES_ :
    - represent a customization of an EC2 instance
        - own software, configuration, operating system, monitoring
        - faster boot time
        - faster configuration time
            (because all the software to be installed onto the EC2 instance are pre-packaged through an AMI)

    - can be copied across regions to leverage AWS global infrastructiure

- can build your own AMI

- EC2 instances can be launched from different kinds of AMI
    - _*PUBLIC AMI*_ : 
        - AWS provided
        - Amazon linux 2 AMI -> popular AMI for AWS
    - _*YOUR OWN AMI*_ :
        - make and maintain AMI yourself
    - _*AWS MARKETPLACE AMI*_ :
        - AMI made by someone else

# EC2 Instance Store

- EBS -> network drives with limited performance

- EC2 instance store -> extremely high performance hardware disk

- They're a virtual machine but obviously attached to a real hardware server. Some of these servers have disk space that is attached directly with a physical connection onto the server.

- _ADVANTAGES_ :
    - better I/O performance
    - good throughput

- _DISADVANTAGE_ :
    - EC2 instance store lose their storage once EC2 instance is stopped / terminated
    - It's called an ephemeral storage
        - not feasible for long term storage (use EBS instead)
    - If online server of the EC2 instance fails, data loss occurs as the hardware attached to the instance will also fail

- _USE CASES_ :
    - buffer
    - cache
    - scratch data
    - temporary content

- _NOTE_ :
    - It's your responsibility to create backups and replicate data correctly based on your needs

# EFS :

- managed NFS (network file system)

- can be mounted on many EC2 instances in multi AZ

- highly available

- scalable

- expensive (3x times gp2 cost)

- pay per use ( no need of provisioning capacity )

- _USE CASES_ :
    - content management
    - web serving
    - data sharing
    - wordpress

- uses BFSv4.1 protocol

- uses SG to control access to EFS

- not compatible with windows (only with Linux based AMI because it is a POSIX file system)


# NOTE :

- EFS is a network file system to be mounted across multiple instances.

- EBS is for a network volume, it should be mounted only on one instance and it is locked to an AZ.

- An Instance Store is to get the maximum amount of IO onto an EC2 instance,but is something you lose, if you lose that instance, so it is an ephemeral drive
