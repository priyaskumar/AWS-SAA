# Scalability and High Availability

### _Scalability_ :

- an application / system can handle greater loads by adapting

- **Vertical Scalability** : (Scale Up/down)

    - increasing size of the instance on which the application runs

    - Eg: scaling from t2.micro to t2.large

    - there's a limit to how much you can vertically scale (**Hardware Limit**)

    - _USE CASE_ : non distributed systems (database)

    - _SERVICES THAT CAN BE SCALED VERTICALLY_ : RDS, ElastiCache

- **Horizontal Scalability** : (Scale out/in)

    - increasing the number of instances / systems for the application

    - Eg : Increasing the number of instances from 1 to 3

    - _USE CASES_ : distributed systems (web applications/ modern applications)

    - Used for 
        - ASG 

        - load balancers

### _High Availability_ :

- usually goes hand in hand with horizontal scaling

- running instances of the same application/system in at least 2 data centers (AZ)

- _GOAL_ : to survive data center loss

- can be active (for horizontal scaling)  
can be passive (for RDS Multi AZ)

- Used with 
    
    - ASG that has multi AZ enabled

    - Load balancer that had multi AZ enables

# Load Balancing

- Load balancer are servers/set of servers that forward traffic to multiple backend servers downstream (EC2 instances for example)

- **Why Load Balancers?**

    - spread load across multiple downstream instances

    - expose a single point of access (DNS) to the application

    - seamlessly handle failures of downstream instances

    - Do regular health checks to the instances

    - Provide SSL termination (HTTPS) for the websites

    - Enforce stickiness with cookies

    - High availability across zones

    - Seperate public traffic from private traffic in the cloud

# Why Elastic Load Balancers?

- a managed load balancer (managed by AWS)

    - AWS guarantees that it is working

    - AWS takes care of upgrades, maintenance, high availability

    - AWS provides only a few configuration knobs to tweak the behavior of the load balancer

- costs less than setting up your own load balancer

- is integrated with many AWS offerings / services

    - EC2, EC2 ASG, Amazon ECS

    - AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), CloudWatch

    - Route 53, AWS WAF, AWS Global Accelerator

# Health Checks

- Health checks are crucial for load balancers

- They enable the LB to know if instances it forwards traffic to are available to reply to requests

- Done by using a port and a route

- If the EC2 instance does not respond with an okay response, which is usually the 200 status code of HDP, then the instance will be marked as unhealthy.And the elastic load balancer will not send traffic to that instance.

# Types of Load Balancers

4 kinds of managed load balancers on AWS:

- _Classic load balancer_ : (CLB)

    - v1 - old generation 
    
    - from 2009

    - compatible with HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, SSL (or secure TCP)

    - shown as deprecated within the console, but still available to use.

- _Application load balancer_ : (ALB)

    - v2 - new generation

    - from 2016 

    - supports HTTP, HTTPS and web socket protocol.

- _Network load balancer_ : (NLB) 

    - v2 - new generation

    - from 2017

    - supports the TCP, TLS (secure TCP) and UDP protocols.

- _Gateway load balancer_ : (GWLB) 

    - from 2020

    - operates at the network layer (layer 3) - IP Protocol

It is definitely recommended to use the newer generation load balancers as they provide more features.

Some load balancers can be set up as internal(private)  or external (private) ELBs

### Load Balancer Security Groups :

- Users can access the LB from anywhere using HTTP or HTTPS

- EC2 instances should only allow traffic coming directly from LB

# Classic Load Balancer (v1)

- supports 

    - TCP (layer 4)

    - HTTP

    - HTTPS (layer 7)

- health checks are TCP or HTTP based

- we get a fixed hostname through which the application is accessed

# Application Load Balancer (v2)

- is layer 7 only (HTTP)

- Latency : 400 ms

- allows to route to multiple HTTP applications across machines (these machines are groupes as a **Target Group**)

- allows to balance multiple applications on same EC2 instance (machine)

- has support for HTTP/2 and websocket

- supports redirects (from HTTP to HTTPS automatically)

- supports route routing. There are routing tables based on different target groups
    
    - routing based on path in URL

    - routing based on hostname in URL

    - routing based on Query String, Headers

- ALB are great fit for micro services and container-based applications (Docker and Amazon ECS)

- has port mapping feature to redirect to dynamic port in ECS

- **Target Groups** :

    - EC2 instances (managed by ASG) -> HTTP

    - ECS tasks (managed by ECS) -> HTTP

    - Lambda functions -> HTTP request translated into JSON event (serverless)

    - IP addresses (private)

- ALB can route to multiple target groups

- Health checks are at the target group level

- we get a fixed hostname

- application servers don't see the IP of the client directly
    
    - `X-Forwarded-For` - true IP of client is inserted in this header 

    - `X-Forwarded-Port` - contains the port 
    
    - `X-Forwaded-Proto` - contains the protocol 

# Network Load Balancer (v2)

- is layer 4 balancers (lower level)

    - forward TCP and UDP traffic to the instances

    - handle millions of request per seconds

    - less latency ~ 100 ms 

- exposes one static IP per AZ
(CLB and ALB had a static host name whereas NLB has a static IP)

- supports assigning Elastic IP (helpful for whitelisting specific IP)

- used for extreme performance, TCP or UDP traffic

- NLBs are not included in AWS free tier

- **Target Groups** :

    - EC2 instances

    - IP addresses (private IP)

    - ALB
    (to leverage the idea of NLB to have fixed static IPs and leverage ALB for all its HDP related features)

# Gateway Load Balancer

- Used to deploy, scale and manage a fleet of third-party network, neutral appliances in AWS

- You would use a gateway load balancer if you want it to have all traffic of your network to go through a firewall that you have or an Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS), a Deep Packet Inspection System or you want to modify some payloads but at the network level. 

- Operates at Layer 3 (Network Layer) IP -> lowest level

- has 2 functions :

    - _Transparent Network Gateway_ : single entry/exit for all traffic in VPC

    - _Load Balancer_ : distributes traffic to your virtual appliances and target group

- uses the GENEVE protocol on ports 6081 (important)

- **Target Groups** :

    - EC2 Instances

    - IP Addresses (private)

# Sticky Sessions (Session Affinity)

- stickiness -> same client is always redirected to the same instance (in backend) behind a load balancer

- this can be enabled for CLBs and ALBs

- `cookie` -> used for stickiness has an expiration data, when the cookie expires the client is redirected to new instance

- _USE CASE_ : user doesn't lose his session data

- enabling stickiness may bring imbalance to the load over the backend EC2 instances

- _2 Types of Cookies_ :

    - **Application-based Cookies**

        - Custom cookie :

            - generated by target
            - can include any custom attributes required by the application
            - cookie name must be specified individually for each target group
            - dont use AWSALB, AWSALBAPP, AWSALBTG

        - Application cookie :

            - generated by the load balancer
            - cookie name is AWSALBAPP

    - **Duration-based Cookies**

        - Cookie generated by the load balancer

        - Cookie name : AWSALB -> ALB ; AWSELB -> CLB

# Cross-Zone Load Balancing

- each load balancer instance distributes evenly across all registered instances in all AZ

- The cross-zone load balancing by default

    - for the ALB, it is always on (no charges for inter AZ)

    - for the NLB, you need to enable it and you're going to pay for it. (pay for inter AZ data transfers)

    - for the CLB, you can enable it and you're not going to pay for it. (no charges for inter AZ)

# SSL/TLS 

- SSL Certificate : allows traffic b/w clients and LB to be encrypted in transit (in-flight encryption)

- SSL -> Secure Sockts Layer

- Used to encrypt connections

- TLS -> Transport Layer Security (newer version of SSL)

- Public SSL certificates are issued by Certificate Authorities (CA) like 
    - Comodo, Symantec, GoDaddy, GlobalSign, Digicert, Letsencrypt

- have expiration date and has to be renewed from time to time

# Load Balancer - SSL certificates

- load balancer uses `X.509` certificate

- can create certificates on own too

- when you set an HTTP listener you must,

    - specify a default cert

    - can add an optional list of certs to support multiple domains

    - Clients can use **SNI** -> **Server Name Indication** to specify hostname they reach

    - ability to specify a security policy to support older versions of SSL/TLS **(legacy clients)**

# Server Name Indication - SSL

- solves the problem of loading multiple SSL certs onto one web server (to serve multiple websites)

- it's a newer protocol and requires the client to indicate the hostname of the target server in the initial SSL handshake

- the server will find the correct certificate or return the default one

- works only for ALB, NLB and cloudfront

- does not work for CLB since it is old gen

# ELB - SSL

- CLB (v1)

    - supports only one SSL

    - must use multiple CLB for multiple hostname with multiple SSL Certs

- ALB (v2)

    - supports multiple listeners with multiple SSL Certs

    - Uses Server Name Indication to make it work

- NLB (v2)

    - supports multiple listeners with multiple SSL Certs

    - Uses Server Name Indication to make it work

# ELB - Connection Draining

- has 2 feature names :

    - Connection draining -> for CLB

    - Deregistration Delay -> for ALB and NLB

- it will give some time for your instances to complete the inflight request or the active request while the instance is being deregistered or marked unhealthy.

- once an instance(connection) is being drained,then the ELB will stop sending your request to the EC2 instance that is being drained while being deregistered.

- draining time : 1 to 3600 secs (default : 300 secs)

- can be disabled (set to 0)

- if requests are short, set it to lower value

# Auto Scaling Group

- when we deploy a website or an application, the load can change over time

- in AWS, it's possible to create and also get rid of servers very quickly with the EC2 instance creation API call.

- _GOAL_ :

    - scale out (add EC2 instances) to match an increased load

    - scale in (remove EC2 instances) to match a decreased load

    - ensure we have minimum and maximum number of EC2 instances running

    - automatically register new instances to a load balancer

    - re create an EC2 instance in case a previous one is terminated

- free to use. charged only for the underlying EC2 instances

# ASG attributes

- a launch template

    - AMI
    - Instance Type
    - EC2 User data
    - Security groups
    - SSH key pair
    - IAM roles for your EC2 instances
    - network + subnets information
    - load balancer information

- min size/ max size / initial capacity

- sclaing policies

# Auto scaling - CLoudWatch Alarms and Scaling

- possible to scale an ASG on CloudWatch alarms

- an alarm monitors a metric 

- based on the alarm:

    - we create scale - out policies (increase no. of instances)

    - we create scale - in policies (decrease no.of instances)

- ### Auto scaling groups - Dynamic Scaling Policies

    - **Target Tracking Scaling**

        - most simple and easy to set up

        - eg : average ASG CPU should stay around 40%

    - **Simple / Step Scaling**

        - when a CLoudWatch alarm is triggered (when CPU utilization is greater than 70%) then add 2 units

        - when a CloudWatch alarm is triggeres (when CPU utilization is lesser than 30%) then remove 1 unit

    - **Scheduled Actions** 

        - Anticipate a scaling based on known usage patterns

        - eg : increase min capacity to 10 at 5 pm on fridays

- ### Auto scaling groups - Predictive Scaling

    - continuously forecast load and schedule scaling ahead

    - metrics to scale on :

        - CPU Utilization - average CPU utilization across your instances

        - RequestCountPerTarget - to make sure the no. of requests per EC2 insatnces is stable (application specific)

        - Average Network In / Out - if application is network bound. to make sure if you reach a certain threshold, then you 're going to scale based on that

        - Any custom metric - pushed using CloudWatch

- ### Auto scaling groups - Scaling Cooldowns

    - after a scaling activity happens, you are in the **cool down** period (default 300 sec)

    - during the cooldown period, the ASG will not launch or terminates additional instances ( to allow for metrics to stabilize )

    - use a ready to use AMI -> reduces config time
    (serves request faster and reduce the cooldown period)


# ASG Default Termination Policy

- find the AZ which has most number of instances

- if there are multiple instances in the AZ to choose from, delete the one with the oldest launch config

- ASG tries to balance the no of instances across AZ by default

# ASG - Lifecycle hooks

- by default, as soon as an instance is launched in an ASG, it's in service

- In Service Lifecycle Hook : 
    - if you design a lifecycle hook on pending state, you can perform extra steps before the instance goes inservice (from pending state)

- Termination Lifecycle Hook :
    - if you design a lifecycle hook on terminating state, you can perform some actions before the instance is terminated (from terminating state)

# ASG - Launch template vs launch config

ID of AMI, the instance type, a key pair, security groups are common to both

### Launch Configuration (legacy)

- must be recreated every time

### Launch Template (newer)

- can have multiple versions

- create parameter susbsets (partial config for re-use and inheritance)

- provision using both on-demand and spot instances

- can use T2 unlimited burst feature

- recommended by AWS
