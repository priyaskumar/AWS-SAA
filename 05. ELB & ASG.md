# Scalability and High Availability

### _Scalability_ :

- an application / system can handle greater loads by adapting

- **Vertical Scalability** : (Scale Up/down)

    - increasing size of the instance on which the application runs

    - Eg: scaling from t2.micro to t2.large

    - there's a limit to how much you can vertically scale (**Hardware Limit**)

    - _USE CASE_ : non distributed systems (database)

    - _SERVICES THAT CAN BE SCALED VERTICALLY_ : RDS, ElastiCache

- **Horizontal Scalability** : (Scale out/in)

    - increasing the number of instances / systems for the application

    - Eg : Increasing the number of instances from 1 to 3

    - _USE CASES_ : distributed systems (web applications/ modern applications)

    - Used for 
        - ASG 

        - load balancers

### _High Availability_ :

- usually goes hand in hand with horizontal scaling

- running instances of the same application/system in at least 2 data centers (AZ)

- _GOAL_ : to survive data center loss

- can be active (for horizontal scaling)  
can be passive (for RDS Multi AZ)

- Used with 
    
    - ASG that has multi AZ enabled

    - Load balancer that had multi AZ enables

# Load Balancing

- Load balancer are servers/set of servers that forward traffic to multiple backend or servers downstream (EC2 instances for example)

- **Why Load Balancers?**

    - spread load across multiple downstream instances

    - expose a single point of access (DNS) to the application

    - seamlessly handle failures of downstream instances

    - Do regular health checks to the instances

    - Provide SSL termination (HTTPS) for the websites

    - Enforce stickiness with cookies

    - High availability across zones

    - Seperate public traffic from private traffic in the cloud

# Why Elastic Load Balancers?

- a managed load balancer (managed by AWS)

    - AWS guarantees that it is working

    - AWS takes care of upgrades, maintenance, high availability

    - AWS provides only a few configuration knobs to tweak the behavior of the load balancer

- costs less than setting up your own load balancer

- is integrated with many AWS offerings / services

    - EC2, EC2 ASG, Amazon ECS
    - AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), CloudWatch
    - Route 53, AWS WAF, AWS Global Accelerator

# Health Checks

- Health checks are crucial for load balancers

- They enable the LB to know if instances it forwards traffic to are available to reply to requests

- Done by using a port and a route

- If the EC2 instance does not respond with an okay response, which is usually the 200 status code of HDP, then the instance will be marked as unhealthy.And the elastic load balancer will not send traffic to that instance.

# Types of Load Balancers

4 kinds of managed load balancers on AWS:

- _Classic load balancer_ : (CLB)

    - v1 - old generation 
    
    - from 2009

    - compatible with HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, SSL (or secure TCP)

    - shown as deprecated within the console, but still available to use.

- _Application load balancer_ : (ALB)

    - v2 - new generation

    - from 2016 

    - supports HTTP, HTTPS and web socket protocol.

- _Network load balancer_ : (NLB) 

    - v2 - new generation

    - from 2017

    - supports the TCP, TLS (secure TCP) and UDP protocols.

- _Gateway load balancer_ : (GWLB) 

    - from 2020

    - operates at the network layer (layer 3) - IP Protocol

It is definitely recommended to use the newer generation load balancers as they provide more features.

Some load balancers can be set up as internal(private)  or external (private) ELBs

### Load Balancer Security Groups :

- Users can access the LB from anywhere using HTTP or HTTPS

- EC2 instances should only allow traffic coming directly from LB

# Classic Load Balancer (v1)

- supports 

    - TCP (layer 4)

    - HTTP

    - HTTPS (layer 7)

- health checks are TCP or HTTP based

- we get a fixed hostname through which the application is accessed

# Application Load Balancer (v2)

- is layer 7 only (HTTP)

- Latency : 400 ms

- allows to route to multiple HTTP applications across machines (these machines are groupes as a **Target Group**)

- allows to balance multiple applications on same EC2 instance (machine)

- has support for HTTP/2 and websocket

- supports redirects (from HTTP to HTTPS automatically)

- supports route routing. There are routing tables based on different target groups
    
    - routing based on path in URL

    - routing based on hostname in URL

    - routing based on Query String, Headers

- ALB are great fit for micro services and container-based applications (Docker and Amazon ECS)

- has port mapping feature to redirect to dynamic port in ECS

- **Target Groups** :

    - EC2 instances (managed by ASG) -> HTTP

    - ECS tasks (managed by ECS) -> HTTP

    - Lambda functions -> HTTP request translated into JSON event (serverless)

    - IP addresses (private)

- ALB can route to multiple target groups

- Health checks are at the target group level

- we get a fixed hostname

- application servers don't see the IP of the client directly
    
    - true IP of client is inserted in the header X-Forwarded-For

    - we can get the port (X-Forwarded-Port) and the protocol (X-Forwaded-Proto)

# Network Load Balancer (v2)

- is layer 4 balancers (lower level)

    - forward TCP and UDP traffic to the instances

    - handle millions of request per seconds

    - less latency ~ 100 ms 

- exposes one static IP per AZ
(CLB and ALB had a static host name whereas NLB has a static IP)

- supports assigning Elastic IP (helpful for whitelisting specific IP)

- used for extreme performance, TCP or UDP traffic

- NLBs are not included in AWS free tier

- **Target Groups** :

    - EC2 instances

    - IP addresses (private IP)

    - ALB
    (to leverage the idea of NLB to have fixed static IPs and leverage ALB for all its HDP related features)
