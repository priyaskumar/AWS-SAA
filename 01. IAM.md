# _IAM : Users and groups_ 


IAM = Identify and Access Management, Global Service

- Root account created by default, shouldn't be used or shared

- Users are people within your organization and can be grouped

- Groups only contain users, not other groups

- Users don't have to belong to a group and user belong to multiple groups

# IAM : Permissions

- Users or Groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies

- Policies define the permissions of the users

- In AWS, apply the `least privilege principle` - don't give more permissions than a user needs

NOTE : use the root account only when it is definetely required

# IAM Policies

_*Inheritance*_

- Policies associated with a group is appplicable to all users in the group

- INLINE POLICY is for a apecific user 

_*Policies Structure*_

- Version : policy language version

- Id : identifier for the policy (optional)

- Statement : one or more individual statements

    - Sid : an identifier for the statement (optional)
    - Effect : whether the statement allows or denies access
    - Principal : account/user/role to which this policy applied to
    - Action : list of actions this policy allows or denies
    - Resource : list of resources to which the actions applied to
    - Condition : conditions for when this policy is in effect (optional)

# Password policy

- strong passwords -> higher security

- can set up own _*password policy*_ in AWS
    - set minimum password length
    - set requirements for specific character types like :
        - uppercase letters
        - lowercase letters
        - numbers
        - special characters
- all IAM users can be allowed to change their passwords
- set password expiration
- prevent re-use of password

# MFA

- To protect Root accounts and IAM users -> Multi Factor Authentication

- MFA = password you know + security device
- Password + MFA -> Successful login
- MFA devices options :
    - Virtual MFA device -> multiple tokens
    - U2F security key -> multiple root and IAM users
    - Hardware Key Fob MFA Device
- Advantage : Account not compromised if password is hacked


# Access keys, CLI, SDK

- Access options for AWS :
    - AWS Management Console (password + MFA)
    - AWS CLI (access keys)
    - AWS SDK (access keys)
- Access Keys generated through AWS console

- _*CLI*_ :
    - Interact with AWS Services using commands in command line shell
    - direct access to public APIs of AWS Services
    - can develop scripts to manage your resources
    - open source
 
- _*SDK*_ :
    - Has language specific APIs
    - access and manage AWS Services programmatically
    - embedded within application
    - Supports :
        - Mobile SDKs (Android, IOS)
        - IoT Device SDKs (Embedded C, Arduino)
        - SDKs for JavaScript, Python, PHP, .NET, Java, GO, Node.js, C++, Ruby

# AWS CloudShell :

- AWS CloudShell is a browser-based shell that gives you command-line access to your AWS resources in the selected AWS region. 
- AWS CloudShell comes pre-installed with popular tools for resource management and creation.

- _Check the version of aws_ :

# IAM roles for service

- Some AWS services will need to perform actions on your behalf which requires some permissions with IAM Roles

- Common Roles :
    - EC2 Instance Roles
    - Lambda Function Roles
    - Roles for CloudFormation

- IAM Roles are a secure way to grant permissions to entities trusted. Some entities are :
    - IAM user in another account
    - Application code running on an EC2 instance
    - An AWS service that needs to act on a resource

# IAM Security Tools 

- IAM Credentials Report -> Account-level  
    A report that lists all the users and the status of their various credentials in your account

- IAM Access Advisor -> User level  
    Lists service permissions granted to a user and last accessed


# _Summary_ 

- USERS : mapped to a physical user
- GROUPS : contains group of users
- INLINE POLICIES : JSON document outlining the permissions for specific IAM user
- POLICIES : JSON document outlining the permissions for users and groups
- ROLES : for EC2 instances, AWS services
- SECURITY : MFA + Password Policy
- AWS CLI : manage AWS services using command line
- AWS SDK : manage AWS services using programming language
- Access Keys : access AWS using CLI or SDK


# _NOTE_

1. You only want to use the root account to    
    - create your first IAM user
    - for a few account and service management tasks. 

    For every day and administration tasks, use an IAM user with permissions.

2. An IAM policy is an entity that, when attached to an identity or resource, defines their permissions.

3. Customers are responsible for defining and using IAM policies.

4. The AWS CLI can interact with AWS using commands in your command line shell.

    The AWS SDK can interact with AWS programmatically.

5. Don't give more permissions than the user needs.

    That is, the principle - "GRANT LEAST PRIVILEGE" has to be applied regarding IAM Permissions.

6. You want to enable MFA in order to add a layer of security, so even if your password is stolen, lost or hacked your account is not compromised.

7. IAM Roles is an IAM entity that defines a set of permissions for making AWS service requests that will be used by AWS services.
